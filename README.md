# Breaking notes

An Android app for taking notes for Breaking (Breakdance) dancers.

* This project is still in development. New features will come in the near future.

# Description

The Breaking Note app is created for dancers to create and record their own training results. The app will include the following features:
- Creating your own moves library: The user is able to record their own movements with some data, including their names, execution difficulties, and the example video recorded by themselves.
- Movesets: With the moves library stored, the user is then able to create their own movesets (in other words, combos, skillsets, etc.) as a sequence of recorded moves.
- More ideas will be added in the future.
